Alphabet Soup Deluxe Issues
---------------------------

[X]Fix position of points text.

[X]Save configuration settings in proper location.

   [X]We should probably just add them to t3f_config.

[X]Fix T3F_FONT rendering for non-outlined fonts.

[X]Implement rendering the top and bottom of the can.

[X]Fix incorrect transparency in soup can texture.

[ ]Optimize 3D can rendering by precalculating and storing the results of
   complex math oparations.

[ ]Overhaul graphics.

   [ ]Use photos and clay models for background elements and sprites.

   [ ]Add a bit of randomness to the soup letters to give them a more organic
      look.

   [ ]Consider using clay models for the soup letters.

[ ]Make all transitions smooth. Objects that move should decelerate to their
   final destination.

[ ]Make objects that enter the scene do so from the far edge of the screen.

   [ ]Need to account for portrait-style windows. Objects entering/exiting from
      the top and bottom also need to check that they are past the edge of the
	  actual screen, not just the virtual display.

[ ]Autodetect the best video mode to start in (4:3 aspect ratio). We should
   avoid forcing a specific video mode at start since we want to remember the
   user's last settings.

[ ]Change NCD Games to T^3 on can texture.
