Alphabet Soup
-------------

Alphabet Soup is a twist on the classic snake game. Complete words to score
points. Your goal is to get as many points as possible before crashing into a
wall or yourself.

This version of the game was built for Resurrection Hack 2018. The goal was to
get the game up and running on modern systems using Allegro 5. If you are
reading this, then you have downloaded the competition version of the game.
There may or may not be newer versions of the game available on our web site
(http://www.t3-i.com).


Installation
------------

This version of the game is distributed as source code. The game was made using
T3F, so it should compile without too much trouble on Windows, MacOS, and
Linux if you have Allegro 5 set up. Change to the 'src' directory and run
'make' to build the game. Switch to the 'bin' directory and run
'alphabet-soup-dx' to launch the game.


Getting Started
---------------

The game starts off with a title screen. Pressing enter will bring up the
game's main menu. From there, you can select your game options and start the
game.


Playing the Game
----------------

Use the arrow keys to turn your worm in the direction you want to go. The goal
is to complete the word that is shown on the bottom of the screen (the word
will not be shown if you are playing Blind Worm mode). Once you make the word,
points will be added and a new word will be selected from the dictionary.

Survive as long as you can and try to get the high score.
